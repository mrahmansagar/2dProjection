# 2D Projection of a 3D volume 

This is a Matlab implementation for taking 2D projection of a 3D object/volume at different angle without using any built-in Matlab functions. 

## What is a projection ?
Taking projection of 3d object/volume means passing a set of parallel X-ray beam at a specific angle and calculate the attenuation of the X-ray beams on a detector plane. So at each angle the 3d object has a 2d projection.
